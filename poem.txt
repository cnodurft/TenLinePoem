this is a poem
this is not a poem
it is such a good poem and I really like it
this is nothing like a poem
no Jonah this is the best thing I have ever written
you are just wrong, this is a essay
you need to use an instead of a because essay starts with a vowel
this is not a grammar lesson
no, this is an incorrect spelling lesson, you spelt grammer wrong
just go eat a snack and clam down
